# How I Built My First Machine Learning Model


---

Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most exciting fields in tech today. As an AI/ML developer and master’s student, I want to share how I built my first ML model — step by step — to help beginners get started.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where computers learn patterns from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.

## The Problem I Solved

I wanted to predict whether an email is spam or not, using a simple dataset with labeled emails.

## Tools and Libraries

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook

## Steps I Followed

1. **Data Collection**
   I used a public spam dataset available online.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   Cleaning text, removing stopwords, and converting words to numerical features using TF-IDF vectorizer.

3. **Model Selection**
   I chose a Logistic Regression model — simple and effective for binary classification.

4. **Training the Model**
   I split the data into training and testing sets and trained the model.

5. **Evaluation**
   Using accuracy and confusion matrix, my model reached about 85% accuracy.

## What I Learned

* Data preprocessing is crucial for good results.
* Simple models can perform well on straightforward problems.
* Experimenting with different algorithms helps improve accuracy.

## Next Steps

I plan to explore deep learning models like LSTMs for more complex text classification.
